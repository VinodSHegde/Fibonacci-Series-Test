# Fibonacci-Series-Test

Fibonacci-Series-Test Folder includes two file:
1. Fibonacci_FizzBuzz_Solution.py
2. Fibonacci_FizzBuzz_Solution_1.py

These two are the Solution file to the given problem with different implementation.

1. Fibonacci_FizzBuzz_Solution.py - Prints the required output in New Line
2. Fibonacci_FizzBuzz_Solution_1.py - Prints the required output in Same Line ( in Series )

The programming Language used here is PYTHON 3

Problem 
Generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), and printing

"Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
"Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
"FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15.
"BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
the value F(n) otherwise.

Modified Fibonacci Number finding Technique emloyed with non general Prime Checking Function.
